MUBAS Innovation Hub Platform for developing and running lab guides.


## Introduction

The MUBAS Innovation Hub is a technology incubation center under the Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences.


From time to time it runs various training programs and at the center of these programs are lab instruction guides which students have to follow.

The vision for this project is to have an online platform which can support development of these guides as well as enable students to access the guides and input their progress.




## Ideas & Ideas

Here is a basic workflow on how the platform would be run ;

* An administrator would be able to create a program i.e Hello Tomorrow Program
* Within a program, different subjects would be created, i.e Programming using scratch
* Within a subject, different activities would be created i.e Activity 1
* Withing an activity,a user would be able to create:
  - Opening Notes
  - Sections i.e Section 1: Introduction to Computers, Section 2: Block Pallets
  - Append media illustrations, images and videos
  - Create a challenge, where the student has to put input which can be assessed later on.
* An admnistrator would be able to create users and enroll them into the different programs.
* Training facillitator or teachers would be able to come into the system and assess the work done by the students.


Essentially the system would support the PRIMM pedagogy approach for structuring learning content.

** Idea : The lab guides can be developed using a flexible language like markdown.
